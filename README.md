"# WordCounting" 

Implement an utility program for counting words that includes
specific letters.

Program should do:

• loan a vocabulary (append or replace).

• add a new word to vocabulary.

• find exact number of words that contain provided letters (a
word should contain all letters)

• (optional) show words that contain provided letters (think of
how a user would want to see a list of words, e.g. don’t show
100500 words if he inputs just one letter.
